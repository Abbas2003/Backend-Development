## **Overview**  
Welcome to the **Backend Development** repository! This project serves as a comprehensive guide and practice hub for building robust backend systems using modern technologies. Whether you're learning backend development or working on advanced backend solutions, this repository has something for you.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Structured Codebase**: Organized and modular code for scalability and maintainability.  
- **RESTful APIs**: Implementation of standard HTTP methods with clear routes.  
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Secure user access with JWT and role-based permissions.  
- **Database Integration**: Seamless interaction with databases (e.g., MongoDB).  
- **Error Handling**: Centralized and efficient error management.  
- **Environment Configurations**: Secure handling of sensitive data using `.env` files.  

---

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.  
- **Express.js**: Lightweight framework for API development.  
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for scalable data storage.  
- **Mongoose**: ODM for MongoDB, offering a schema-based solution.  
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**: Secure token-based authentication.  
- **dotenv**: Configuration for environment variables.

   cd Backend-Development
   ```
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Set up the environment variables:  
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
   - Add the required configurations (e.g., `PORT`, `DB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`).  
4. Start the server:  
   ```bash
   npm start
